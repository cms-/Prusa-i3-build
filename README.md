# Prusa-i3-build
### Sourced individual parts and assembled, calibrated, and tested a customized Prusa i3 3D printer

Print video from various iterations. Printer was continuously tuned and upgraded in an effort to refine the print quality and performance. Initial build used an eckertech eckstruder (3.0mm direct drive), but the mass of the extruder that was originally designed for the RepRap contributed to poor performance. A bowden configuration using an E3D v6 hotend significantly improved the performance of the y-axis due to its reduced mass.
